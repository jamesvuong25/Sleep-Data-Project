**PROJECT FOCUS**: 
The project is a study and exploration my sleeping data this semester. This repository is filled with code for mining my sleep data from a combination of manual data collection, weather APIs, and data downloaded from my watch app. 
The study's purpose is to  is used to show how school work, weather, and other factors have an affect on the amount of sleep I get each day.


**RUNNING THE FILES**:
utils.py stores all of the functions I used throughout the project. To run the project, go to main.ipynb, where all of the data, EDA, and hypothesis testing occurs, and simply run that program.
